## 2026-08-12 - Retire Automatic Industry Roles Legacy Reads in Two Stages

**Implementation pattern:** Make the canonical store own a side-effect-free
empty revision-zero seed. Remove legacy payload arguments from the store,
engine, and protected API instead of retaining unused path injection. Preserve
the exact injected canonical state path for both API reads and mutations.

**Verification insight:** A static filename-owner oracle catches accidental
legacy fallback more reliably than behavior tests alone. Pair it with negative
fixtures where valid-looking legacy files exist beside a missing or invalid
canonical state, and prove they are ignored.

**Authority boundary:** Keep the explicit emergency export through the natural
R2 observation window, but do not apply it. Removing that surface is R3 and
requires a successful R2 result plus separate deployment-owner authorization.

**Apply when:** A compatibility source is absent in production and automatic
reads can be retired independently from the last explicit recovery projection.

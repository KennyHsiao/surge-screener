## 2026-08-12 - Retire Automatic Industry Roles Legacy Reads in Two Stages

**Implementation pattern:** Make the canonical store own a side-effect-free
empty revision-zero seed. Remove legacy payload arguments from the store,
engine, and protected API instead of retaining unused path injection. Preserve
the exact injected canonical state path for both API reads and mutations.

**Verification insight:** A static filename-owner oracle catches accidental
legacy fallback more reliably than behavior tests alone. Pair it with negative
fixtures where valid-looking legacy files exist beside a missing or invalid
canonical state, and prove they are ignored.

**Authority boundary:** Keep the explicit emergency export through the natural
R2 observation window, but do not apply it. Removing that surface is R3 and
requires a successful R2 result plus separate deployment-owner authorization.

**Apply when:** A compatibility source is absent in production and automatic
reads can be retired independently from the last explicit recovery projection.

## 2026-08-15 - Retire the Explicit Industry Roles Export Surface

**Implementation pattern:** Once the natural producer window and second owner
authorization pass, delete the export command, manifest codec/writer, and
inspection fields as one bounded slice. Keep canonical inspection and guarded
backup restore byte-for-byte on their existing transaction path.

**Verification insight:** The durable oracle is negative: reject the retired
CLI command, recursively require zero production filename/export-symbol owners,
and prove restore preview, wrong-ETag rejection, apply, revision, and backup
rotation still work. A one-time runtime exact-path preflight must replace the
removed permanent manifest inspection during rollout.

**Review correction:** Do not replace a retired phase-gate field with a
hard-coded `PASS`; remove it. Also search the whole current contract document
for stale R1/R2 present-tense claims, not only the paragraph being edited.

**Baseline note:** `make test` still exposes four detached-main fixture/artifact
failures; each reproduced on `origin/main`, while every R3-focused and remaining
non-baseline entry passed.
